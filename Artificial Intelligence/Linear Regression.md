[[Supervised Learning]]

---
One of the most basic form of [[Machine Learning]],  it is used to **predict numeric values**.
It try to find a line that fits better with the dataset, in order to be closer as possible to every points.
If we miss one value, the linear regression can predict it.
It predict a numeric value, like the possibility of be saved or not by the Titanic, based to some passenger infos.
