It takes data, how the output should be and figure the rules for us in order to make. It needs lot of data in order to generate a possible true output with different input. It can throw errors. 

It wants to emulate our brain, but because of we don't know how it works, it tries.
Very important are the types of input, in order to train correctly the network.

Machine Learning uses an algorithm in order to find rules for us to solve a problem.

There are three types of learning:
- [[Usupervised Learning]]
- [[Supervised Learning]]
- [[Reinforcement Learning]]

There are also a lot of algorithms, such as:
- [[Linear Regression]]
- [[Classification]]
- [[Clustering]]
- [[Hidden Markov Models]]

Inside the Machine Learning  is included the [[Deep Learning]]
