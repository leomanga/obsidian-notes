*[[Machine Learning]] library.*

-------
#### We can use it to do:
- Image Classifications
- Data Clustering
- Regression
- Reinforcment Learning
- Natural Language Processing

#### It has 2 main components:
- **Graphs of partial computation.
- **Sessions, it execute a part or all graph.

### New Tensor

```python
t = tf.zeros([5,5,5,5])
```
New Tensor of 4th grade, with shape 5 for every subvector.

### Reshaping

```python
tf.reshape(t, [625]
```
It reshape the vector in another vector of grade 1 and 625 of shape.
