# Obsidian Notes


Welcome to my **Obsidian Notes**, the hub for my university notes on **mathematics**, **physics**, **computer science**, and **economics**, enriched with personal reflections and ideas.  

This vault is designed for **exploration without boundaries**, you can start from any concept and follow the links to uncover connections across topics. 
There’s no need to begin at the “start” of a subject; every note is part of a larger network, allowing for organic learning and discovery.  

Thanks to Obsidian's linking system, knowledge here is not linear but interconnected, constantly expanding as new insights emerge.
